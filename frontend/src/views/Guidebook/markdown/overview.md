# Overview

## What is Mintbean?

Mintbean is a talent incubator helping software developers get access to employers faster. We work to accelerate the careers, skillsets, and professional networks of software developers globally.

## What is Mintbean CareerHack?

CareerHack is a regularly recurring series of hackathons hosted by Mintbean for the benefit of its participants. We hope that our participants find CareerHack useful and enlightening.

## CareerHack's Mission and Goal

CareerHack's mission is to ultimately help software developers find jobs faster. In service of this mission, there are several goals that the CareerHack series aims to reach:

1. To help participants create a habit of regularly repeating coding practice.
1. To offer participants a chance to show off their skillsets and build their portfolios.
1. To educate participants about software development best practices.
1. To familiarize participants with industry-standard design patterns.
1. To entertain participants.

## Who are these hackathons for?

This hackathon is for developers of all levels who have some experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What is the Mintbean community?

The Mintbean community is a network of developers interested in personal and professional development. Community participation is encouraged through our Discord channel. 

**For Hackathon participants:** The hackathons and the community are two sides of the same coin, so get involved and say hello! :-)

## Schedule

### Short-format hackathons

Short-format hackathons are 4-hour "bursts". These are designed to encourage daily coding practice. The goal in short-format hackathons is to learn to build new types of projects every week.

* Solo.
* 12pm-4pm.
* Mondays and Wednesdays (excluding Ontario statutory holidays).
* Often (but not always) followed by a Hireside Chat.

### Long-format hackathons

Long-format hackathons are 3-day project-style hackathons. These are designed to encourage the building of more involved projects. The goal in long-format hackathons is to take on challenges that test participants' software development abilities.

* Solo.
* 12pm Friday to midnight Sunday.
* Fridays (REGARDLESS of Ontario statutory holidays).
* Not followed by a Hireside Chat.

## Winning is optional

CareerHack hackathons are built to optimize learning. As such, winning is optional. Not all participants aim to win at CareerHack, and making mistakes is encouraged as a natural part of the learning process.
